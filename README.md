# sql-final-project
For my final project I decided to look at NBA data. I found a dataset on Kaggle that had data from the start of the NBA till 2023. There were multiple files so it was great for SQL. The data set only has data till 2023.
With data that goes back to the start of the NBA I wanted to see what team has won the most, and if that team has the highest plus minus. I would also like to see how many players on the NBA top 75 players are still in the league, and how long player who were drafted 1st onverall in the draft played in the league.
Loading in the data I noticed there was no data in the team info common table. All of the other tables had info. I did not set up foreign keys but the tables were set up for them so I was still able to use joins. 
Without any info in the team info common table it made some of the things I wanted to do a bit harder but I was still able get the info with the game info table it was just seperated by home wins and away wins. The Boston Celtics, Los Angeles Lakers, and New York Knicks have the most home and away wins. The Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers also have the highest home plus minus. The San Antonio Spurs have the highest, and the kNew York Knicks have the 8th. All NBA teams had a negitive plus minus on the road. With the lowest being the Denver Nuggest. They had the 10th highest at home. 
There are 9 players still ative in the league who are on the NBA top 75 players of all time.
